Capstone Project 
To determine the completeness and robustness of a data science project, it's important to evaluate several aspects. Here's how to address each question:

1. Unit Tests
Are there unit tests for the API?
Check if there are unit tests specifically written to validate the functionality of the API endpoints.
Are there unit tests for the model?
Verify if there are tests that check the model's performance, accuracy, and expected outputs.
Are there unit tests for the logging?
Ensure there are tests that confirm the logging system works correctly and logs the necessary information.
2. Comprehensive Unit Testing
Can all of the unit tests be run with a single script and do all of the unit tests pass?
Confirm that there's a unified script (e.g., using a tool like pytest or unittest) that can run all tests and check if they all pass successfully.
3. Performance Monitoring
Is there a mechanism to monitor performance?
Check if there are tools or scripts in place to monitor the performance of the model and API (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana, or custom monitoring scripts).
4. Isolation of Read/Write Tests
Was there an attempt to isolate the read/write unit tests from production models and logs?
Ensure that unit tests, especially those that involve read/write operations, do not affect the production environment. This can be done using mock objects or separate test environments.
5. API Functionality
Does the API work as expected? For example, can you get predictions for a specific country as well as for all countries combined?
Test the API endpoints to verify they return correct predictions for specific inputs and aggregated inputs.
6. Data Ingestion Automation
Does the data ingestion exist as a function or script to facilitate automation?
Verify the presence of automated scripts or functions that handle data ingestion efficiently.
7. Model Comparison
Were multiple models compared?
Check if there was an evaluation of different models to determine the best performing one.
8. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Did the EDA investigation use visualizations?
Ensure that the EDA phase included visualizations to better understand data patterns and distributions.
9. Containerization
Is everything containerized within a working Docker image?
Confirm that the project is containerized using Docker, making it easier to deploy and scale.
10. Model vs. Baseline Comparison
Did they use a visualization to compare their model to the baseline model?
Check if visualizations were used to compare the performance of the developed model against a baseline model.
These steps will help ensure the project is robust, reliable, and well-documented.
